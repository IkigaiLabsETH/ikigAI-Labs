- We use `IndexDB` to store local data, it will not be uploaded to the server.
- Provides different conversations modes，support `Single Conversation`, `Continuous Conversation`, `OpenAI Image Generation`、`Stable Diffusion` and more.
- Powered by `Provider plugin` , easy to extend AI platforms such as [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), and also supports custom model parameters.

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com) - We're using the brand new [text-embedding-ada-002](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model/) embedding model, which captures deeper information about text in a latent space with 1536 dimensions
  - This allows us to go beyond keyword search and search by higher-level topics.
- [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io) - Hosted vector search which enables us to efficiently perform [k-NN searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) across these embeddings

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## YouTube
- Navigate to the root directory of the repository in your terminal.
- Run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
- Run the command `npx tsx src/bin/resolve-yt-playlist.ts` to download the English transcripts for each episode of the target playlist (in this case, the All-In Podcast Episodes Playlist).
- Run the command `npx tsx src/bin/process-yt-playlist.ts` to pre-process the transcripts and fetch embeddings from OpenAI, then insert them into a Pinecone search index.
- You can now run the command `npx tsx src/bin/query.ts` to query the Pinecone search index.
(Optional) Run the command `npx tsx src/bin/generate-thumbnails.ts` to generate timestamped thumbnails of each video in the playlist. This step takes ~2 hours and requires a stable internet connection.
- The frontend of the project is a Next.js webapp deployed to Vercel that uses the Pinecone index as a primary data store. You can run the command npm run dev to start the development server and view the webapp locally.

Note that a few episodes may not have automated English transcriptions available, and that the project uses a HTML scraping solution for this, so a better solution would be to use Whisper to transcribe the episode's audio.

## ASCII ART PLUGIN

ChatGPT Plugin which renders text as ASCII art.

[Live manifest file](https://chatgpt-plugin-ascii-art.transitive-bullshit.workers.dev/.well-known/ai-plugin.json)

- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- [@cloudflare/itty-router-openapi](https://github.com/cloudflare/itty-router-openapi)


## LEX FRIDMAN PLUGIN

This is a ChatGPT retrieval plugin which gives ChatGPT access to all of the transcriptions across 360+ episodes of the [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/). It contains a single API route.


- [Dexa API](https://dexa.ai/) (currently in private beta)

Here's an example [live manifest file](https://chatgpt-plugin-dexa-lex-fridman.transitive-bullshit.workers.dev/.well-known/ai-plugin.json). API endpoints are protected so only OpenAI can access them.

[Dexa](https://dexa.ai) has already done all the hard work of aggregating, transcribing, processing, and indexing the Lex Fridman Podcast (and many other podcasts!).

Under the hood, they're doing **a lot** of really awesome, AI-powered data processing:

- Transcriptions with speaker labels (diarization) for attribution (using [Assembly](https://assemblyai.com))
- Automatic post-processing for common transcription errors
- Advanced chunking based on metadata, topic detection, and sentence structure
- Metadata extraction and enrichment with support for photos of speakers
- Heirarchical clustering and summarization

Lex Fridman Podcast stats from [Dexa](https://dexa.ai/) as of April 5, 2023:

- Total number of episodes: 364
- Total characters transcribed: 45,005,793
- Total audio length: ~36 days

## Getting Started

- get your api key from https://openai.com/api/

You can check if Yarn is installed on your PC with the command `yarn --version`

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### OpenAI Magic with GPT-4.20

This project is using OpenAI and its API layer. It is baked in with Authentication, Session Management, Token Tracking, as well as Billing (currently disabled). This MVP will fully understand the structure of the Ikigai Labs XYZ codebase and the tech stack we use, including TailwindCSS, Nextjs, Typscript, P5js, Javascript, React, Nodejs, etc etc. It will understand how to enter the right prompts to get the most out of openai as our coding assistant to publish for example a new minting page, or develop new features, or fix issues in our code. It will also be able to assist us with P5js scripts needed for the Ikigai Labs Gen Art Series.

## Introduction

To start using the project, you will need the following. Node version 14 or above, MongoDB Cloud, an OpenAI account and key and Python.

### Starting Guide

Prepare the following items

- OpenAI account + API Key
- MongoDB Cloud instance database (free tier) + Cluster/Login
- NodeJS
- StripeJS (not required unless implementing billing)

### Installation

- Perform a NPM install or Yarn in the rood directory to install modules
- Update the ENV keys (or ENV.DEV) for your environemnt (for OpenAI, Mongo Etc)
- - MongoDB requires Cluster, Database, Username and Password
- For PC `npm run api` to start the instance of the project
- For Mac `npm run apimac` to start the instance of the project
- Start the Create React App using `npm start`

On first run, the database will initialise with an admin user at `/routes/middleware/mongo.js` which can be updated

You will be able to login with the following details:
`Username: admin@domain.com // Password: KeepingHumanSafe101`

You should have an instance of the backend and frontend running.

For more information, please follow the video attached to this project. This is a starter template. Support is not included as part of the download. Debugging and such will need to be performed at on your own, as well as implementing features.

There is the option to add Stripe, which is currently configured for subscriptions, you will need to connect the Stripe API, Webook URL, and create pricing plans (tempalates provided).

## Adding Prompts

The following steps need to be completed to add one new prompt on the backend and frontend.

### Part 1: Frontend

Head to `./src/tools/` to add the option to use a prompt on the frontend:

- Copy an existing prompt structure, and relabel the title, description, examples (eg, summarize.js -> helloworld.js)
- Update the intended backend url call path on the prompt to `/helloworld`
- Then import the new file add and it to the array on index.js

### Part 2: Backend

Head to `/routes/ai/` to add to the backend a new file

- Copy an existing file prompt call such as (eg. summarize.js -> hellowworld.js)
- Update the listen POST path to `/helloworld`
- Import the new file and add it to the array on index.js

Restart the client and backend server. The new prompt should show up. I've added an example hello world for testing purposes.

### Part 3: Customise Promtps

Udpate the backend and frontend queries to define the kind of prompt you want to query OpenAI with, as well as the kind of output you wish. There are examples for plaintext and listed prompts as part of this process.

GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can now access plugins and other APIs through the OpenAI API. This expands the possibilities for external GPT applications. In addition, GPT-3.5 gets a 16k context window via API, four times larger than ChatGPT

# OpenAI Edge

A TypeScript module for querying OpenAI's API using `fetch` (a standard Web API)
instead of `axios`. This is a drop-in replacement for the official `openai`
module (which has `axios` as a dependency).

As well as reducing the bundle size, removing the dependency means we can query
OpenAI from edge environments. Edge functions such as Next.js Edge API Routes
are very fast and, unlike lambda functions, allow streaming data to the client.

The latest version of this module has feature parity with the official `v3.3.0`.

> **Update July 2023:** The official `openai` library will use `fetch` in v4,
> hopefully making `openai-edge` redundant. You can try it in beta now, more
> info here: https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/182

## Installation

```shell
yarn add openai-edge
```

or

```shell
npm install openai-edge
```

## Responses

Every method returns a promise resolving to the standard `fetch` response i.e.
`Promise<Response>`. Since `fetch` doesn't have built-in support for types in
its response data, `openai-edge` includes an export `ResponseTypes` which you
can use to assert the correct type on the JSON response:

```typescript
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi, ResponseTypes } from "openai-edge";

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const response = await openai.createImage({
  prompt: "A cute baby sea otter",
  size: "512x512",
  response_format: "url",
});

const data = (await response.json()) as ResponseTypes["createImage"];

const url = data.data?.[0]?.url;

console.log({ url });
```

## With Azure

To use with Azure OpenAI Service you'll need to include an `api-key` header and
an `api-version` query parameter:

```typescript
const config = new Configuration({
  apiKey: AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseOptions: {
    headers: {
      "api-key": AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
    },
  },
  basePath: `https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`,
  defaultQueryParams: new URLSearchParams({
    "api-version": AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION,
  }),
});
```

## Without global fetch

This module has zero dependencies and it expects `fetch` to be in the global
namespace (as it is in web, edge and modern Node environments). If you're
running in an environment without a global `fetch` defined e.g. an older version
of Node.js, please pass `fetch` when creating your instance:

```typescript
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration, undefined, fetch);
```

## Without global FormData

This module also expects to be in an environment where `FormData` is defined. If
you're running in Node.js, that means using v18 or later.

## Available methods

- `cancelFineTune`
- `createAnswer`
- `createChatCompletion` (including support for `functions`)
- `createClassification`
- `createCompletion`
- `createEdit`
- `createEmbedding`
- `createFile`
- `createFineTune`
- `createImage`
- `createImageEdit`
- `createImageVariation`
- `createModeration`
- `createSearch`
- `createTranscription`
- `createTranslation`
- `deleteFile`
- `deleteModel`
- `downloadFile`
- `listEngines`
- `listFiles`
- `listFineTuneEvents`
- `listFineTunes`
- `listModels`
- `retrieveEngine`
- `retrieveFile`
- `retrieveFineTune`
- `retrieveModel`

## Edge route handler examples

Here are some sample
[Next.js Edge API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/edge-api-routes)
using `openai-edge`.

### 1. Streaming chat with `gpt-3.5-turbo`

Note that when using the `stream: true` option, OpenAI responds with
[server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).
Here's an example
[react hook to consume SSEs](https://github.com/dan-kwiat/react-hooks#useserversentevents)
and here's a [full NextJS example](https://github.com/dan-kwiat/chat-gpt-clone).

```typescript
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai-edge";

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const handler = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);

  try {
    const completion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: "Who won the world series in 2020?" },
        {
          role: "assistant",
          content: "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.",
        },
        { role: "user", content: "Where was it played?" },
      ],
      max_tokens: 7,
      temperature: 0,
      stream: true,
    });

    return new Response(completion.body, {
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Content-Type": "text/event-stream;charset=utf-8",
        "Cache-Control": "no-cache, no-transform",
        "X-Accel-Buffering": "no",
      },
    });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error(error);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(error), {
      status: 400,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  }
};

export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

export default handler;
```

### 2. Text completion with Davinci

```typescript
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi, ResponseTypes } from "openai-edge";

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const handler = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);

  try {
    const completion = await openai.createCompletion({
      model: "text-davinci-003",
      prompt: searchParams.get("prompt") ?? "Say this is a test",
      max_tokens: 7,
      temperature: 0,
      stream: false,
    });

    const data = (await completion.json()) as ResponseTypes["createCompletion"];

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data.choices), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error(error);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(error), {
      status: 400,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  }
};

export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

export default handler;
```

### 3. Creating an Image with DALL·E

```typescript
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi, ResponseTypes } from "openai-edge";

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const handler = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);

  try {
    const image = await openai.createImage({
      prompt: searchParams.get("prompt") ?? "A cute baby sea otter",
      n: 1,
      size: "512x512",
      response_format: "url",
    });

    const data = (await image.json()) as ResponseTypes["createImage"];

    const url = data.data?.[0]?.url;

    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ url }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error(error);

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(error), {
      status: 400,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  }
};

export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

export default handler;
```

//

### Reasons to consider using `openai-fetch`:

- Supports all envs with native fetch: Node 18+, browsers, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, etc
- Package size: `openai-fetch` is [~5kb](https://bundlephobia.com/package/openai-fetch) and `openai-node` is [~180kb](https://bundlephobia.com/package/openai-node)
- `openai-fetch` includes the first choice in the response (no repetitive: `response.choices[0.text]`)
- You only need the completions, edits, and embeddings endpoints

### Use `openai-node` if you need:

- Endpoints other than completions, edits, and embeddings
- Streaming response support (this may be added later)
- Responses to contain more than one choice (no `n` support)
- To use tokens instead of strings for input

## Usage

Install `openai-fetch` with your favorite package manager and create an instance of the `OpenAIClient` class.

```ts
import { OpenAIClient } from 'openai-fetch';

const client = new OpenAIClient({ apiKey: '<your api key>' });
```

//

## API

The API follows OpenAI very closely, so their [reference documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference) can generally be used. Everything is strongly typed, so you will know if anything is different as soon as TypeScript parses your code.

### Create Completion

See: [OpenAI docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) | [Type definitions](/src/schemas/completion.ts)

```ts
client.createCompletion(params: CompletionParams): Promise<{
  /** The completion string. */
  completion: string;
  /** The raw response from the API. */
  response: CompletionResponse;
}>
```

To get a streaming response, use the `streamCompletion` method.

```ts
client.streamCompletion(params: CompletionParams): Promise<
    ReadableStream<{
      /** The completion string. */
      completion: string;
      /** The raw response from the API. */
      response: CompletionResponse;
    }>
  >
```

### Create Chat Completion

See: [OpenAI docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) | [Type definitions](/src/schemas/chat-completion.ts)

```ts
client.createChatCompletion(params: ChatCompletionParams): Promise<{
  /** The completion message. */
  message: ChatResponseMessage;
  /** The raw response from the API. */
  response: ChatCompletionResponse;
}>
```

### Create Embedding

See: [OpenAI docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings) | [Type definitions](/src/schemas/embedding.ts)

```ts
client.createEmbedding(params: EmbeddingParams): Promise<{
  /** The embedding for the input string. */
  embedding: number[];
  /** The raw response from the API. */
  response: EmbeddingResponse;
}>
```

### Create Edit

See: [OpenAI docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits) | [Type definitions](/src/schemas/edit.ts)

```ts
client.createEdit(params: EditParams): Promise<{
  /** The edited input string. */
  completion: string;
  /** The raw response from the API. */
  response: EditResponse;
}>
```
